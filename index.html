        <h2>
          If we’re going to build this future, we have to do it in the open,
          with clear rules and clear hearts.
        </h2>
        <p class="lead">
          AI and robots are arriving either way. The question isn’t
          “can we stop it?” — it’s “who do they serve, and how do we
          live with them?”
        </p>

            <h2>The Worry</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>“Robots will take our jobs.”</li>
              <li>“AI will flood the world with garbage.”</li>
              <li>“A few companies will own everything.”</li>
              <li>“Everything is moving too fast to be safe or fair.”</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Those aren’t irrational fears. They’re signals.
              This project exists because we take them seriously.

            <h2>The Alternative</h2>
            <p>
              We want robots that live with us, not above us:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>trustworthy, warm, honest about what they are</li>
              <li>doing real work in homes and cities</li>
              <li>built with clear limits and accountability</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Not grey stormtrooper machines. 
              Not ad billboards on wheels.
              Real helpers. House-bots. 
              Companions with boundaries.

        <h2>JAMMERS — The Robotics Backbone</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          JAMMERS is the engineering backbone 
          that lets Serge-like bots exist:
          a modular, CUDA-powered robotics 
          platform designed for home-scale embodied AI.

            <h3>Design Goals</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Modular</strong> — parts can be swapped, repaired, and upgraded.</li>
              <li><strong>Safe</strong> — power and logic separated; failures fail safe, not dramatic.</li>
              <li><strong>Scalable</strong> — from pet-scale companions to mid-sized helper droids.</li>
              <li><strong>Transparent</strong> — documented architecture instead of mystery boxes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Core Architecture</h3>
            <p><strong>Compute</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>3× NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano modules</li>
              <li>C++ end-to-end, accelerated with CUDA</li>
              <li>Each module with a clear role:
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Coordinator</strong> — speech, planning, connectivity</li>
                  <li><strong>Vision</strong> — cameras, depth, spatial understanding</li>
                  <li><strong>Motion</strong> — locomotion, balance, actions</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p><strong>Power</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Distributed LiFePO₄ battery system</li>
              <li>Separate rails for compute, motors, peripherals</li>
              <li>Designed to reduce electrical noise, spikes, and cascades</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Motion / Chassis</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>20 cm ball-drive base with stabilization</li>
              <li>NEMA-class steppers + DM542 drivers</li>
              <li>Grasping arm/hand for simple manipulation tasks</li>
              <li>Mechanical design intentionally scalable to heavier frames later</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Safety & Fault Tolerance</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Each AI core runs on its own power + data domain.</li>
              <li>If one domain fails, others can shut down safely or
                  load minimal models to <strong>limp home</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="quote">
              No runaway behavior. No drama.
              When things go wrong, the robot gets small, honest, and safe.

              Lives online. Handles the boring admin:

              Lives in your home, in a body.
              Helps with cooking support, cleaning runs,
              basic repairs, kid-wrangling, tutoring, and small errands.
            </p>
            <p>
              It learns how your household works and how you like things done,

            <p>
              Once it can do meaningful chunks of the work, it takes on those tasks —
              and the wages go to you, the trainer and owner.
              Robots don’t erase your contribution; they multiply it.

            <li><strong>Safety</strong> — each helper has a clear role and clear limits.</li>

            Many small, bounded helpers are safer than one giant unchecked brain.

        <h2>Who’s Building This?</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          This is an applied robotics lab project: one engineer, a lifetime
          of systems thinking, and a stubborn refusal to leave the future
          of embodied AI hidden behind closed doors.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal is simple and difficult at the same time:
          build a trustworthy, lovable, technically serious house-bot platform
          the public can actually live with.
        </p>
        <p>
          If embodied AI is coming into homes, it should be shaped by people
          who care about everyone.
